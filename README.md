# Data Science Outer London House Price Estimator: Project Overview
* Created a tool to estimate the house prices for propeties < 40 miles from central London less than £325k (MAE ~ £19K) to help people when looking for homes at commutable distance. 
* Scraped over 900 property descriptions from zoopla.co.uk using python and beautifulsoups.
* Engineered features from the text of each decsription to quantify the value house prices have on garden, largeness, spaciousness and whether or notthe propety has been extended.
* Optimised Linear, Lasso, and Random Forest Regressors using GridsearchCV to reach the best model.
* Built a client facing API using flask
